"3: You are one in a million baby, no, you are the only one in this world, and you are perfectly perfect.",

"4 : You have no idea about the impact you've had on me from the very first day since we started talking to each other.",

"5 : I never knew that I will open to someone even 1 percent of how much you know me. And you make me happy every single day in one or the other day, even if I'm shit angry on you.",

"6 :I still remember the first day we texted, I remember how you were afraid of talking to after 10, but now? ",

"7 : I remember all your silly pickup lines, and it's embarassing to admit that I loved all of that, and maybe I actually fell for those.",

"8 : I remember the day I talked on call with you for the first time, I never, never talked to anyone like I did with you, and trust me I didn't wanted that call to end.",

"9 : I remember how you always made me happy, I remember how you opened up to me for the first time, and it was about gym, I still remember how much I loved you talking to me like that and trusting me so much.",

"10 : I remember how you used to like your cousin, and I hated it, you have no idea how possessive I am about you, and you will never know.",

"11 : I remember the day we first met, I don't know where I got that courage, you may have even turned out as a kidnapper, but baby you know I just knew that you weren't. I knew that I could trust you. I don't know how.",

"12 : I remember your birthday last year, how I was trying to play with you telling I'll sleep, but you were so chill about it, and when I asked, you told me that I couldn't forget your birthday, were you scared this time?",

"13 : You are 22 now, and I don't know how you grew up so fast, I was not a part of your life for almost 21 years, but I'll be a part of your life more than that, hopefully.",

"14 : I can't buy you expensive things baby, this is all I can do, and I genuinely hope that it makes you atleast 1 percent happy, and makes your day a little better and atleast brings a small smile on your face.",
"15 : Do you remember how we celebrated new year together, and fought after that? We fight a lot, but we are still together, that means our fights are not as strong as our bond. And I love that fact.",

"16 : I wore your jhumka today, and I've got so many compliments for that. And I love that you gave it to me. It's yours. And I love it so so so much.",

"17 : I know that you are very dominant, you want everything to happen according to you, but I know how to handle you, because I'm your Sthuthi. I know you better than anyone else.",

"18 : One thing I do not like about you is that you try to hide a lot of things from me, and I don't like it. Next time onwards promise me that you'll share everything with me.",

"19 : It's your day today baby, enjoy it to the fullest, spend it however you want. Do whatever you love. And remember I'll always wish you first.",

"20 : Do you remember how you sent me a snap of Sahyadri before my exam and wished me luck, do you even know how much happy it made me, I've showed it to all my friends. And that is one of the most sweetest gesture I've ever witnessed.",

"21 : Baby do you know that the universe is expanding everyday? That's same as my love for you, it expands everyday, so much that it scares me.",
